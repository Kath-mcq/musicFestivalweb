            <h1>Tickets & Age</h1>
            <p>As stated in our FAQ, 16 and those older may attend the event. Due to the amount of attraction the festival gets and the artists preforming this year,
                it wouldn't be a suitable place for kids. Tickets are avaliable for teenagers, adults and families. More information is avaliable in Tickets.
